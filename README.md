# Optimizing Hours Allocation with Constraints in a PC Tech Company

The PC Tech company assembles and then tests two models of computers, Basic and XP.  

For the coming month, the company wants to decide how many of each model to assemble and then test.  

No computers are in inventory from the previous month, and because these models are going to be changed after this month, the company doesn’t want to hold any inventory after this month.  

It believes the most it can sell this month are 600 Basics and 1200 XPs.  

Each Basic sells for $300 and each XP sells for $450.  

The cost of component parts for a Basic is $150;  for an XP it is $225.  

Labor is required for assembly and testing.  

There are at most 10,000 assembly hours and 3000 testing hours available.  

Each labor hour for assembling costs $11 and each labor hour for testing costs $15.  

Each Basic requires five hours for assembling and one hour for testing, and each XP requires six hours for assembling and two ours for testing.  

PC Tech wants to know how many of each model it should produce (assemble and test) to maximize its net profit, but it cannot use more labor hours than are available, and it does not want to produce more that it can sell.


All optimization models have several common elements:

Decision variables, the variable whose values the decision maker is allowed to choose. The values of these variables determine such outputs as total cost, revenue, and profit.

An objective function (objective, for short) to be optimized – minimized or maximized. 

Constraints that must be satisfied. They are usually physical, logical, or economic restrictions, depending on the nature of the problem. 
In searching for the values of the decision variables that optimize the objective, only those values that satisfy all of the constraints are allowed.
